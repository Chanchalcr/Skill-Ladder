    <h2>Why us and Our end goal</h2>
    <p>Statistics from the AISHE 2019-20 by MHRD show that of the 30 Lakh+ students graduate with 6 Lakh engineers, and 80% of those engineers do not possess the skills required in the current industry, and hence they eventually struggle in the industry.
        Here at Skill Ladder, we strive to bring a change with completely indigenous courses taught by Indian instructors.
        We want to make the youth of India more employable and self-dependent.
